In this project we will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the 
World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

We will use a combination of Matplotlib and eaborn to create visualizations. 

We will attempt to preprocess, explore and analyze data.
